This addon will enable Smart Excerpts for posts and attachments when using WP FullText Search with the Avada theme.

== Description ==

The ingenious and wonderful Avada theme uses its own post excerpts generator for search results, which prevents you from seeing the beautiful Smart Excerpts from the [WP FullText Search plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fulltext-search/ "Download").

This addon disables the excerpts generator from Avada, and plugs in Smart Excerpts from WPFTS plugin, and does so with a hook, without modifying the original theme code.
